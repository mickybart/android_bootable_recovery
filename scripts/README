relink-binaries.sh

Intended to "relink" or change the linker path for a linked binary. Normally
linked binaries are looking for the linker in /system/bin/linker (or
/system/bin/linker64 for 64 bit devices). In recovery, we want to avoid
mounting or using anything /system to allow us to install different
ROMs or firmware. This script will run various sed commands to update the
path to the linker to /sbin/linker64 or /sbin/linker which is sometimes
needed especially for qseecomd (decrypt) or in some cases with user space
touch screen binaries. Usage:

./relink-binaries.sh filename

The script will leave the existing file untouched and make a new file
named filename-1-mod



compare_xml.py

Intended to compare two different language xml files to determine if any
strings do not match up between the two files. Sometimes we add or rename
or misspell string names. This script will help identify the discrepancies.
Usage:

python compare_xml.py -o target.xml
